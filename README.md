#Raindrops
## Overview 
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate simple Java programming techniques as well as
being an exercise in employing thorough quality-assurance and testing for it.

##Testing
This mini-project has taken a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, which means the test cases
and accompanying expected outputs has been defined before any methods have been created. This 
allows for one to go into the development process knowing full-well what the expected outcome of
any developed code should be. 

Due to the fact that there is no development code once the test cases are completed, these tests
will immediately fail, the task of the developer is now to write code which makes these tests 
pass.
